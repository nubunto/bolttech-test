# Bolttech Test

To run the backend, enter the `backend` directory and run:

```
$ yarn
$ yarn global add gulp
$ gulp
$ node dist/index.js
```

This should bring the backend up at the default port 4000 on localhost.

You can then run the front-end by going in the `front-end` directory and running:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
